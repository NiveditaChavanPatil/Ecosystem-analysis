# Ecosystem-analysis
This Python-based project simulates and analyzes a startup ecosystem by generating dummy data for startups across various industries, funding rounds, and geographical locations in India. It leverages data visualization and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights. 
# Startup Ecosystem Analyzer

This project is a data analysis tool built in Google Colab that simulates and explores startup ecosystem trends using synthetic data. It helps visualize funding patterns, industry distributions, top startup hubs, and investor activity across multiple dimensions.

## Project Overview

The Startup Ecosystem Analyzer creates and analyzes simulated startup data (industry, location, funding rounds, valuation, etc.) to mimic a real-world startup landscape. The tool is designed for data analysis practice, research exploration, and understanding how startup ecosystems evolve over time.

## Key Features

- Generates realistic dummy data for startups
- Displays total funding, unique companies, and deal metrics
- Time-series visualization of funding trends
- Industry-wise startup distribution (pie chart)
- Top startup cities (bar chart)
- Funding stage metrics (count, mean, total, average valuation)
- Investor-level analysis and deal breakdown
- Average funding by industry over the years
